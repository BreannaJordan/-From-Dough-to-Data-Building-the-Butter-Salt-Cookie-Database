# -From-Dough-to-Data-Building-the-Butter-Salt-Cookie-Database


## 1. What This Project Is
The Butter & Salt Database Capstone Project is a real-world database system created for my home-based cookie business, using fully anonymized and simulated data for privacy. Developed for the APCV 498 Senior Capstone course, this project demonstrates an end-to-end design of a functional relational database—from schema creation to data population to analytical SQL queries. Its purpose is to show how small businesses can use structured data to understand performance, track orders and customers, and make informed operational decisions. The primary audience for this project is my professor and classmates reviewing database design and implementation.

## 2. What’s Included in This Project
### SQL Folder
 Contains all SQL scripts used to build and analyze the database.
- Database creation scripts – Creates the Butter & Salt database environment.
- Table creation & normalization scripts – Defines all 3NF-normalized tables (customers, orders, cookies, ingredients, etc.).
- Data import scripts – SQL INSERT queries used to populate each table with mock data.
- Business insight queries – Analytical SQL queries that pull meaningful insights (e.g., sales trends, repeat customers, revenue patterns).

### CSV Folder
Includes all mock data files used to populate the database:
- CSV files for each table – Contains simulated data for customers, orders, cookies, ingredients, inventory, and other business entities.
- These files allow the database to be populated quickly without manual entry.

### Images Folder
Contains visual and presentation assets:
- Project poster – High-level visual summary of the capstone project.
- Schema diagram – Visual layout of tables and relationships.
- ERD diagram – Entity–Relationship Diagram showing the full structure.
- Data visualizations – Graphs and charts generated from SQL business insight queries (e.g., sales trends, customer patterns).

### Query Results Folder
Stores output files created by running analytical queries:
- Monthly sales revenue results
- Repeat customer analysis
- Other query output files or screenshots
- These demonstrate how the database answers real business questions.

## 3. Overview of the Database
The Butter & Salt database is a fully normalized relational database designed to support the operations of a real cookie business using simulated data. It organizes core business information—customers, orders, cookies, ingredients, and sales activity—into structured tables that follow Third Normal Form (3NF) to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
The database allows the business to track customer behavior, analyze sales patterns, and support operational decisions through well-designed SQL queries. It demonstrates how a small product-based business can transform raw data into actionable insights through a properly structured database system.
### Key Components of the Database
- Customer Management – Stores customer information, contact details, and order history.
- Order Processing – Tracks each order, order items, quantities, pricing, and order status.
- Product & Recipe Data – Organizes cookie types, ingredients, production information, and related details.
- Sales & Performance Tracking – Enables analysis of monthly revenue, best-selling cookies, repeat customers, and other business metrics.
- Inventory & Ingredient Usage (if included) – Allows estimation of ingredient demand and production planning.
### Design Highlights
- Tables are normalized to 3NF for efficient and consistent data storage.
- Primary and foreign keys clearly define relationships between entities.
- The schema supports realistic business workflows for a bakery or cottage-food company.
-Analytical queries demonstrate how the database can answer real operational questions.

## 4. How to Use This Project
1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. Run the schema file located in /SQL (01_schema.sql).
3. Run the data insertion file (02_insert_data.sql).
4. Execute the stored procedures and example queries in /SQL or /Query Results.
