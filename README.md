# -From-Dough-to-Data-Building-the-Butter-Salt-Cookie-Database


## 1. What This Project Is
The Butter & Salt Database Capstone Project is a real-world database system created for my home-based cookie business, using fully anonymized and simulated data for privacy. Developed for the APCV 498 Senior Capstone course, this project demonstrates an end-to-end design of a functional relational database—from schema creation to data population to analytical SQL queries. Its purpose is to show how small businesses can use structured data to understand performance, track orders and customers, and make informed operational decisions. The primary audience for this project is my professor and classmates reviewing database design and implementation.

## 2. What’s Included in This Project
- SQL files that create the tables and add sample data  
- A schema diagram (picture of the database structure)  
- A research poster with visuals  
- Sample data created using Mockaroo  
- My written capstone report  

## 3. Overview of the Database
- The database has 7 tables  
- It stores cookies, customers, orders, order items, and more  
- Tables are connected using primary keys and foreign keys  
- It allows reporting on sales, trends, and customer patterns  

## 4. How to Use This Project
1. Open MySQL Workbench  
2. Create a new schema  
3. Run the CREATE TABLE scripts  
4. Import the sample data  
5. Run the stored procedures to get reports  
   (like monthly sales or popular cookies)

## 5. What This Project Can Do
- Shows most popular cookies  
- Shows low-sales months  
- Tracks customer order habits  
- Helps plan for production and marketing  

## 6. Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
